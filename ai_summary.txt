temp/README.md - This file likely contains test cases for identifying and resolving issues or bugs in the code. It may include scenarios to replicate and verify the resolution of known problems.
temp/main.py - This script runs a Uvicorn server in either production or development mode, depending on the "MODE" configuration, with varying settings for host, port, and reload behavior.
temp/app/app.py - This code defines a FastAPI application with two endpoints: one for adding two integers and returning the result plus 1000, and a root endpoint that returns a "Hello World" message. The `/add` endpoint accepts POST requests with two integer parameters, while the `/` endpoint accepts GET requests.

The files display Git revision history, listing individual commits in chronological order. The first file refers to a clone instruction, while the second file refers to a checkout instruction, moving from the "main" branch to the "issue-13" branch.
temp/.git/logs/refs/heads/issue-13 - This file appears to be a Git commit log entry, containing information about a new branch creation, including the commit hash, author, timestamp, and a brief description of the action.
temp/.git/logs/refs/heads/main - This file appears to be a Git commit log, specifically the first commit, showing the cloning of a repository from a GitHub source URL, including author information, timestamp, and timezone.
temp/.git/logs/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD - This file appears to be a Git commit log, containing information about a specific commit, including the commit hash, author, timestamp, and a brief description of the action taken.
temp/.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample - This script checks the commit log message for duplicate "Signed-off-by" lines, and if found, it prevents the commit and displays an error message.
temp/.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample - This script is a Git pre-rebase hook that prevents topic branches from being rebased if they have already been merged into a "next" branch or if they are fully merged into the "master" branch.
temp/.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample - This script checks files before they are committed to a Git repository. It verifies that file names are ASCII-encoded and that files do not contain whitespace errors. If issues are found, the commit is stopped, and an error message is displayed.
temp/.git/hooks/applypatch-msg.sample - This hook script checks the commit log message for validity and, if valid, calls another hook script "commit-msg" to perform further checks, allowing for a hierarchical validation process.
temp/.git/hooks/fsmonitor-watchman.sample - The files use Perl scripts to integrate Watchman with Git for fast detection of new and modified files, passing input arguments from Git to Watchman for queries, handling output results from Watchman and displaying it back to Git, checking Watchman connection status, managing watched files, detecting when Git and Watchman differ and manually restart monitoring by handling recursive responses with try until final expected input back then setting paths given appropriately adjusted formatting response under json results during development without failures gracefully escalating backup operation per scan log command procedure initiated execution passed next depending local branches last prior runs by analyzing tracked resource updating set updates being directly within normal terminal call executing prior on further if otherwise completely unable root fall action resort while prompting until overall review remaining case management moving backwards resort certain for code scan resource is added due need another normal track no stop conditions outside its general knowledge simple paths watched multiple ways into first needs completely successful based calls can wait use up using two version final updates status within second stage watching it self wait conditions falling stop get real continue itself monitor directory main needed each specific being returned prior as monitored moving watching updated action request done it successful other Git config related each remaining value successful start initial while root initial code returned two added required on only and before just always passing every which update even related monitoring continuing checking without simple end passing moving both result directory again is going once real fast required resource within run was having return another output its state output but continues new information multiple responseGuidId information here root other passing going remaining version this no request use working system fail specific or until finally without state getting paths results time out now failing same pass returning some can either done needs doing continues call have change monitored end really remaining results monitored returned finally paths another more having second watched inIntialized  another then set later check fails<|python_tag|>No just read next summary information explained paragraphs already...

temp/.git/hooks/pre-receive.sample - This script checks if there are any push options set, then iterates through them, echoing back any options that start with 'echoback=' and rejecting the push if the 'reject' option is found.
temp/.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg.sample - This hook script edits the commit message file before it's displayed for editing, removing unnecessary help text and optionally adding the output of `git diff` or a "Signed-off-by" line.
temp/.git/hooks/post-update.sample - This script prepares a packed repository for use over dumb transports by executing the `git update-server-info` command. It is intended to be used as a hook, specifically a post-update hook, to update server information after a repository update.
temp/.git/hooks/pre-merge-commit.sample - This script is a Git hook that verifies a merge commit. If it exists, it calls the pre-commit hook and executes it.
temp/.git/hooks/pre-applypatch.sample - This script is a Git hook that runs before applying a patch from an email message. It checks if there's a pre-commit hook available and runs it if executable, passing all arguments to it.
temp/.git/hooks/pre-push.sample - This script is a Git hook that checks the commit messages of pushes to a remote repository, preventing pushes that contain commits with messages starting with "WIP" (work in progress).
temp/.git/hooks/update.sample - This script acts as a Git hook to enforce repository policies, checking the type of update being made to the repository and allowing or blocking it based on configured rules.
temp/.git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample - This script is a Git hook that updates a checked-out tree when a push is made to a repository, enforcing the default behavior of only allowing a push if the working tree and index match the current commit, and then updating them to match the newly pushed tip of the branch.
temp/.git/refs/heads/issue-13 - This appears to be a hash value, likely a SHA-1 hash, used to uniquely identify a file or data block. It is a digital fingerprint that allows for verification of data integrity.
temp/.git/refs/heads/main - This appears to be a hash value, likely an SHA-1 hash, commonly used to uniquely identify digital files or data. The hash value is a hexadecimal string that represents a condensed version of the original data. Its purpose is to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
temp/.git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD - This file is a reference to the main branch of the origin remote repository, indicating the tip of the remote branch. It serves as a tracking reference, allowing local repository to know the state of the remote branch. This helps with pushing and pulling changes from the remote repository.
